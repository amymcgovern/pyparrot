			<arg name="flag" type="u8">
				Boolean flag: 1 if the roll and pitch values should be taken in consideration. 0 otherwise

			<arg name="roll" type="i8">
				Roll angle as signed percentage.
				On copters:
				Roll angle expressed as signed percentage of the max pitch/roll setting, in range [-100, 100]
				-100 corresponds to a roll angle of max pitch/roll to the left (drone will fly left)
				100 corresponds to a roll angle of max pitch/roll to the right (drone will fly right)
				This value may be clamped if necessary, in order to respect the maximum supported physical tilt of the copter.

				On fixed wings:
				Roll angle expressed as signed percentage of the physical max roll of the wing, in range [-100, 100]
				Negative value makes the plane fly to the left
				Positive value makes the plane fly to the right
			</arg>
			<arg name="pitch" type="i8">
				Pitch angle as signed percentage.
				On copters:
				Expressed as signed percentage of the max pitch/roll setting, in range [-100, 100]
				-100 corresponds to a pitch angle of max pitch/roll towards sky (drone will fly backward)
				100 corresponds to a pitch angle of max pitch/roll towards ground (drone will fly forward)
				This value may be clamped if necessary, in order to respect the maximum supported physical tilt of the copter.

				On fixed wings:
				Expressed as signed percentage of the physical max pitch of the wing, in range [-100, 100]
				Negative value makes the plane fly in direction of the sky
				Positive value makes the plane fly in direction of the ground

			<arg name="yaw" type="i8">
				Yaw rotation speed as signed percentage.
				On copters:
				Expressed as signed percentage of the max yaw rotation speed setting, in range [-100, 100].
				-100 corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation of max yaw rotation speed
				100 corresponds to a clockwise rotation of max yaw rotation speed
				This value may be clamped if necessary, in order to respect the maximum supported physical tilt of the copter.

				On fixed wings:
				Giving more than a fixed value (75% for the moment) triggers a circle.
				Positive value will trigger a clockwise circling
				Negative value will trigger a counter-clockwise circling
			</arg>
			<arg name="gaz" type="i8">
				Throttle as signed percentage.
				On copters:
				Expressed as signed percentage of the max vertical speed setting, in range [-100, 100]
				-100 corresponds to a max vertical speed towards ground
				100 corresponds to a max vertical speed towards sky
				This value may be clamped if necessary, in order to respect the maximum supported physical tilt of the copter.
				During the landing phase, putting some positive gaz will cancel the land.

				On fixed wings:
				Expressed as signed percentage of the physical max throttle, in range [-100, 100]
				Negative value makes the plane fly slower
				Positive value makes the plane fly faster
