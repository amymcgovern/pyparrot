   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pyparrot's documentation!
====================================
pyparrot was designed by Dr. Amy McGovern to program Parrot Minidrone (primarily Mambo FPV but Swing is also
supported) and Parrot Bebop (1 or 2) drones using Python.  This interface was developed to teach kids of all ages (K-20) STEM
concepts (programming, math, and more) by having them program a drone
to fly autonomously.  Anyone can use it who is interested in
autonomous drone programming!
